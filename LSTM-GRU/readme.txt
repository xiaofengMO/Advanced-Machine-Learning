ALL the result can be view by jupyter notebook, the result are already printed in the notebook
running it again may take a very long time
recover actions are done by calling the recover script with different input arguments to recover different models

Task 1: Task_1_Recover.ipynb
Task 2: Task_2_recover.ipynb, Task_2_b_recover.ipynb
Task 3: Task_3.ipynb

the recovered images for task 3 are stored in the third column of 

2X2_pixels_inpainting_new.npy
one_pixel_inpainting_new.npy

############################################################
The above is all you need for result


############################################################
some recover action are done by sending command to recover script in notebook

Task 1: Task_1_recover_script.py
Task 2: Task_2_recover_script.py

input arguments are required since the script are built for multiple model, the notebook has the code the run the recover scripts.

############################################################
Training and inpainting script are

Task 1: Task_1_script.py
Task 2: Task_2_script.py, Task_2_in_painting_script.py
Task 3: do not need to train, the result are located in Task_3.ipynb

This script are set for multiple models, input arguments are required
############################################################
script are set for training, to run multiple model sequentially on the same script
Task 1: Task_1_run.py
Task 2: Task_2_run.py, Task_2_b_run.py
